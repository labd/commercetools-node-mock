# Express vs Fastify Migration: Final Recommendation

## TL;DR: **Stay with Express** for now

After comprehensive research, while Fastify offers technical advantages, the migration cost outweighs the benefits for commercetools-node-mock at this time.

## Research Summary

### Performance Benefits of Fastify
- ✅ 2-3x better request throughput (35k vs 15k req/sec)
- ✅ 56% lower latency
- ✅ 15% lower memory usage
- ✅ Better TypeScript support
- ✅ Modern async/await design

### Migration Costs
- ❌ **17 days** of development effort (3.5 weeks)
- ❌ **65+ service files** need modification
- ❌ Risk of introducing bugs
- ❌ Team learning curve
- ❌ Potential MSW integration issues

## Decision Rationale

1. **Current Express implementation is stable** and meets requirements
2. **Performance is not a bottleneck** for a mock server
3. **High migration effort** (17 days) vs uncertain benefits
4. **Risk of regression** in stable codebase
5. **Team productivity** would decrease during migration

## When to Reconsider

Revisit Fastify migration if:
- Performance becomes a critical bottleneck
- Starting a new major version (breaking changes acceptable)
- Team has excess capacity for modernization projects
- Community specifically requests better performance

## Research Artifacts

Complete research package available in `/research/` including:
- Proof-of-concept implementations for both frameworks
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Bundle size analysis
- Detailed migration roadmap
- MSW integration validation

This research provides a foundation for future decision-making when circumstances change.

**Recommendation**: Continue with Express. Invest the 17 days in new features or improvements that directly benefit users instead of internal technical migrations.
