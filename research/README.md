# Express vs Fastify Research

This directory contains research materials for evaluating whether to migrate from Express to Fastify in commercetools-node-mock.

## Research Goals

1. **Performance Comparison**: Benchmark request handling performance
2. **Bundle Size Analysis**: Compare final build sizes
3. **Migration Effort**: Assess complexity of migrating existing codebase
4. **Feature Parity**: Ensure Fastify can handle all current requirements
5. **Ecosystem Support**: Evaluate available plugins and community support

## Structure

- `proof-of-concept/` - Fastify implementation samples
- `benchmarks/` - Performance comparison tests
- `analysis/` - Research findings and documentation
- `bundle-analysis/` - Bundle size comparisons

## Key Areas to Research

1. Request/Response handling patterns
2. Middleware equivalent (plugins in Fastify)
3. Error handling differences
4. TypeScript support and type safety
5. MSW integration compatibility
6. Authentication/OAuth2 implementation
7. Routing patterns and organization
8. Performance characteristics
9. Memory usage
10. Community and ecosystem maturity
